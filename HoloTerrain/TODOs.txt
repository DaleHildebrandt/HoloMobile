TODOs:
-Allow for 3D screenshots
-Create a Matrix 4x4 class to simplify rotation matrix for drawable objects
-Clean up Calibrator code (ensure it still works)
-Organize Terrain code (maybe seperate interaction )
-Fix issue preventing accurate selection when terrain is rotated
-Restrict clipping to only the terrain, not selector ray (potentially markers as well)

-Verify that the clipPlane code has not been messed up
