###HoloTerrain README###

## Description
HoloTerrain is a VC++ project created in Visual Studio 2010. It draws an interactive 3D terrain onto the screen that moves with respect to a Vicon-tracked mobile device, in an effort to emulate a mobile device that can project a hologram from the top.

## Requirements
This project requires the use of a zSpace 3D stereoscopic system, Vicon motion tracking system, and a mobile Android device (with the accompanying Android application) in order to run. It also requires the installation of the zSpace (32-bit) SDK. This project uses SDK version 2.8.0.1453. According to zSpace, this project should work on earlier versions of the SDK, but I have yet to verify that.
